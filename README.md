## About
I'm a legal researcher with a focus on data and technology law. Currently, I'm a JSD researcher at [Humboldt University Berlin] (https://www.rewi.hu-berlin.de/en/lf/oe/rhp/dynaminthome) (supervised by [Prof. Martin Eifert] (https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/DE/Richter/Erster-Senat/BVR-Prof-Dr-Eifert/bvr-prof-dr-eifert_node.html)) and an Affiliate at the [Information Law Institute] (https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili) at New York University. My research focuses on law's impacts on data and internet governance, with a special focus on the governance of AI. Some of my publications also address other issues of (European) public law as well, specifically human and fundamental rights law.
