## About
I'm a legal researcher with a focus on data and technology law. After having completed my JSD at [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.rewi.hu-berlin.de/en/lf/oe/rhp/dynaminthome) supervised by [Prof. Martin Eifert](https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/DE/Richter/Erster-Senat/BVR-Prof-Dr-Eifert/bvr-prof-dr-eifert_node.html), I am currently a clerk with the Berlin regional court as well as a post-doctoral researcher at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://lawcs.zar.kit.edu/) and an affiliate researcher at the [Information Law Institute](https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili) at New York University. My research mostly concerns law's impacts on data and internet governance, with a special focus on the governance of AI. Some of my publications also address other issues of (European) public law, specifically human and fundamental rights law.

## Misc
**Music** is life, which is why I really like it. If you're looking for a playlist that includes both annoyingly wonderful radio pop and 17-minute-ambient-pieces, you might like [this one](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/23SfFqM1jvFDVQvM2KLU1S?si=3aeb89b1858a40ca) or [this one](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/23SfFqM1jvFDVQvM2KLU1S?si=7776dffff54341b7).

**Movies**, too, are life and sometimes when I watch one I list and review it [here](https://mubi.com/users/11360000).
